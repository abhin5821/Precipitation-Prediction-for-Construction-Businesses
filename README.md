# Precipitation Prediction for Construction Businesses

## Description:
This project focuses on predicting precipitation for the construction industry for the next 1-2 years(specific monsoon months) using historical data and machine learning techniques under the Theme-"Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Response.

### Dataset: 
The project utilizes a CSV file named "Historic_dataset.csv" containing historical precipitation data for years and months.

### Model Training and Predictions:

- The code employs the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model for time series forecasting.
- It trains the model on historical data for specific months (June, July, August, September, and June-September combined).
- The trained model then predicts precipitation for the next five years (2021-2025) based on the chosen month.
- Evaluation Metrics:

### Features

- The primary feature used for prediction is likely the historical precipitation values for the chosen month(s).
- The code might be adaptable to include additional features that could influence precipitation, such as temperature, humidity, or location data (if available).


### Challenges
- Weather prediction is inherently complex and subject to various factors.
- The accuracy of predictions can be limited by the quality and historical range of the data used to train the model.
- External factors like climate change can also introduce uncertainty into the predictions.
- Unavailability and inaccessable to the data.
